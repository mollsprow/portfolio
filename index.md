I've been making content, code and design for the web since 1998.
<br/>Ouch.

*More content goes here.*

You can use HTML elements, as well. Markdown will just turn into generic
`p` tags and the like, so you don't need to do too much to make things
work.

Any content in this document is used in the `_layouts/default.html` file automatically,
replacing the `{{ content }}` variable.

This is done to reuse the layout without needing to repeat the sidebar code
and other layout portions of the site, making it easier to just write page content!

As always, if you need help, ask G. â™¥
