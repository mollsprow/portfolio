Having touched products and experiences from conception to delivery since the early 00s, I've had my fair share of time exploring design from all angles. As the landscape changed so did my skills; my roots in front-end development and graphic design gradually transformed to a well-seasoned human-centered designer with a deepening love for UX research. 

I'm focused on learning and doing the ground work to inform design, shaped by the humans and environments surrounding a project. I have fun discovering what questions to ask, and understanding why I am asking them. I like looking at the problem from different perspectives, identifying processes and methods that may not be the most popular, but are the best suited to learn. I thrive in cross-functional and collaborative environments, and I get excited about combing through details and sharing information. 

I'm invested in UX research. I am here to learn from, grow with, and educate the humans I interact with. 

On the flip side I'm a mom, a traveler, a flea market fan, an aging punk rocker, and I have an unhealthy obsession with cheese.

You can use HTML elements, as well. Markdown will just turn into generic
`p` tags and the like, so you don't need to do too much to make things
work.

Any content in this document is used in the `_layouts/default.html` file automatically,
replacing the `{{ content }}` variable.

This is done to reuse the layout without needing to repeat the sidebar code
and other layout portions of the site, making it easier to just write page content!
